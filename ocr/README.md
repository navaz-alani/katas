Each entry is 4 lines long, and each line has 27 characters. The first 3
lines of each entry contain an account number written using pipes and
underscores, and the fourth line is blank. Each account number should have 9
digits, all of which should be in the range 0-9. A normal file contains
around 500 entries.
Example:

```txt
    _  _     _  _  _  _  _
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|

```
